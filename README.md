# Intel® VTune™ 2019 DKMS Modules

This project's primary goal is to provide DKMS compatible Linux kernel modules, along with `udev` rules, for Intel® VTune 2019 or later.

This project currently does not supply distribution packaging files, but we may be willing to accept pull requests containing them.

## Licensing Terms

The majority of the source code contained within this repository was authored by Intel®, and is available under only the GPL version 2.

To keep licensing simple, all additional files created by the project are also licensed GPL version 2.

## Are you Intel®? Help out!

If you know or know of an engineer at Intel®, please tell them about this project!

I am **very** hopeful that parts of this project could become the default manner in which these kernel modules are distributed.
